DigitalOcean Spaces is S3-compatible object storage. S3 compatible meaning, it supports the aws-s3-sdk. At least for [the most part](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/spaces-api/#aws-s3-compatibility). This guide will help you set up and configure a DigitalOcean Space for the development environment.

### Creating a Space.

- Head over to the DigitalOcean project page and click on the green **_Create_** button on the top bar.
- From the drop-down list select **_Spaces_**

### Setting up a Space

**Selecting a region**

- Select a region from the available list. I like to choose the one which is located closer to me.

**CDN**

- Enable CDN by clicking on the Enable CDN button. This will help deliver content much faster to the end-user irrespective of their location. If you updated something on the origin server, you can purge the cache from the CDN to force an update for the new copy.

**Private or Public Listing**

- You can restrict file listing, meaning only authorized users would be able to list and get info about the space.
- An important thing to remember, this setting doesnâ€™t affect the visibility of individual files. Their visibility can be changed from the dashboard of the space.

**Select a name**

- Enter a name for your space. The name should be unique across all spaces hosted by DigitalOcean. So make sure you name your space accordingly. I personally prefer naming my space like this `{name-of-project}-{what-will-it-hold}-uploads`
- For example, if I am uploading say music cover-art, I would name my space `awesome-project-coverart-uploads`

**Hit Create!**

### Configuring a Space

Once the space is created successfully, it will show up under the resources tab in the project dashboard.

- To configure a Space, click on the space and head over to the **Settings** tab. The Settings tab allows you to edit most of the options that we available while creating the space. The most important one to get the space working is the **CORS Configurations** setting.
- To set up cors correctly for the **development environment**, click on the Add button.
- Fill up the values as shown in the image below.
- Hit Save Options.

A few things to observe,

- The origin value needs to be a wild card. `localhost` doesn't seem to work. In production, replace the wildcard with the actual domain name.
- You need to add a wildcard header in the **Allowed Headers** section. If not present, all requests would throw a CORS error.

**Thatâ€™s it! You are now ready to upload and read files from the space!**
